Exercise "factorial":

As always, read the entire task description carefully before you begin solving the problem.

Copy this file to your own solution folder. Write your solution into the copy.

-------

Write a function named "factorial".
Scroll down to find the place in this file where you should write the function.

The factorial function should:
    - have one parameter named number.
    - calculate the factorial of this number and store the result in a variable named result.
    - return the result.

If you can't remember the definition of a factorial, read this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial)

In the main program:
    - Write a line of code that stores the integer 5 in a variable called factorial_input.
    - In the next line of code, call the factorial function with factorial_input as the argument,
      and store the result of this function call in a variable named factorial_result.
    - In the next line of code, print "5! = 120" using the variables factorial_input and factorial_result.

Run the program. "5! = 120" should be printed to the console.
Change the first line in the main program to "factorial_input = 6".
Run the program again.
This time, "6! = 720" should be printed to the console.

If you get stuck, ask Google, the other students, an AI, or the teacher.

When your program is finished, push it to your GitHub repository.
Then, continue with the next file.
